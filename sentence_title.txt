Timely and reliable estimation of RAC facilitates many function units of autonomous vehicles, e.g., collision avoidance systems (    Hu et al., 2023    ), which in turn reduces the incidence of dangerous traffic accidents, especially on poor road surfaces covered with water, ice, and snow.	    list reference    	 J.

The existing methods for estimating RAC are categorized into two types, i.e., effect- and cause-based estimation methods.	    list reference

The cause-based methods do not utilize vehicle dynamics models and are not affected by vehicle motion, and some of them can even perceive the pavement adhesion information ahead of the vehicle in advance.	    list reference    	 
The above two types of studies provide some useful methods for estimating RAC.	    list reference    	 
However, the effect-based methods not only rely on accurate tire model calculation and sufficient tire excitation but also have the problem of time lag.	    list reference    	 
To simplify the computational process, implicit or homogenizing assumptions are deployed to simplify the computational process, which may lead to deviation of the solution procedure from the actual vehicle motion.	    list reference    	 
Moreover, the estimated RAC is close to the real value only when the tires are subjected to sufficient road excitation and generate appropriate deformations.	    list reference    	 
Additionally, the dynamic response of tires and vehicles can only occur when the tires come into contact with the road surface, which makes it impossible for effect-based methods to predict the road condition ahead of the vehicle in advance.	    list reference    	 
Correspondingly, the cause-based methods are heavily dependent on high-precision sensors and highly robust algorithmic models.	    list reference    	 
Compared with expensive radars and acoustic sensors with poor interference immunity, cameras with lower hardware costs are gradually becoming the basic sensors for environment perception in autonomous vehicles due to their significant advantages in capturing texture feature information of the driving environment (    Nolte et al., 2018    ).	    list reference    	 Nolte, M., Kister, N., & Maurer, M.

Compared with other tire models, the Dugoff tire model possesses fewer parameters.	    list reference    	 
Moreover, the Dugoff tire model can intuitively separate the variables of side-slip angle, side-slip, vertical tire pressure, and RAC.	    list reference

Two road surface images are fed into two parallel feature extractors.	    list reference    	 
Feature extractors learn high-dimensional features of road surface images by alternating and stacking convolutional kernels and pooling operation, and then the image features are converted into vectors using flatten layer.	    list reference    	 
After that, the fusion of feature vectors of two images is carried out at fully connected layer, yielding a one-dimensional feature vector                                              f    ∈    R    1   ×   N          for road surface images, among it,  N  is the number of features, which varies with different feature extractors.	    list reference

Information about physical features parameters is embedded in conventional deep learning (CDL) model to improve ante-hoc interpretability of the model.	    list reference    	 
Mean Square Error (MSE) is employed in the training of the VDMIDL and CDL model to compute the loss for metering the deviation degree between the label value and RAC estimation value.	    list reference

Unlike most datasets (e.g., KITTI and Cityscape), the RSCD presents more detailed annotations of images of road surface conditions, taking into account road materials (e.g., asphalt, concrete, gravel, and mud), friction levels (e.g., dry, wet, water, ice, fresh snow, and melted snow), and road unevenness (e.g., smooth, slight unevenness, and severe unevenness).	    list reference    	 
The three road properties are combined into 27 types of road surface conditions, which fulfills the research requirements for estimating RAC in this paper.	    list reference

What's more, when the road conditions suddenly changed to wet-asphalt-smooth and wet-concrete-slight at about 10.87 s and 16.80 s, it can be observed from    Fig. 13    that compared with the DIBF, CDL, and UKF-based models, the VDMIDL model perceives changes in road conditions in advance and predicts the RAC of the road ahead of the vehicle in time.	    list reference    	  
The performance of the VDMIDL model is timely, sensitive, and stable in the face of sudden changes in road conditions, which makes the actual vehicle motion more in line with the requirements of the decision-making, planning, and control.	    list reference

Fig. 12    shows the nonuniform road condition, i.e., dry-asphalt-smooth road with a length of 55 m, wet-asphalt-smooth road with a length of 35 m, and wet-concrete-slight road with a length of 25 m.	    list reference    	  
The real RAC of different road sections, measured by a BM-III pendulum friction coefficient tester, is 0.85, 0.68, and 0.55, respectively.	    list reference    	 
The wet-asphalt-smooth and wet-concrete-slight road sections are artificially set through water spraying.	    list reference    	 
The vehicle travels at approximately 20 km/h along the prescribed route and performs several lane-changing operations at appropriate times.	    list reference    	 
Fig. 13    shows the test results of the RAC estimation models under nonuniform road condition.	    list reference    	  
The results show that the MAEs of RACs estimated by the VDMIDL, DIBF, CDL, and UKF-based models are 0.018, 0.027, 0.031, and 0.042, respectively.	    list reference    	 
It can be seen that the RAC estimated by the VDMIDL model is closer to the real RAC and more stable with the smallest absolute error, compared with that estimated by the CDL, DIBF, and UKF-based models, at three types of road surface conditions.	    list reference    	 
What's more, when the road conditions suddenly changed to wet-asphalt-smooth and wet-concrete-slight at about 10.87 s and 16.80 s, it can be observed from    Fig. 13    that compared with the DIBF, CDL, and UKF-based models, the VDMIDL model perceives changes in road conditions in advance and predicts the RAC of the road ahead of the vehicle in time.	    list reference    	  
The performance of the VDMIDL model is timely, sensitive, and stable in the face of sudden changes in road conditions, which makes the actual vehicle motion more in line with the requirements of the decision-making, planning, and control.	    list reference

As shown in    Fig. 11    (a) and (b), the accuracy of UKF-based estimation, between approximately 1.41 ∼ 18.23 s, is higher than that between 0 ∼ 1.41 s and 18.23 ∼ 19.38 s, due to the higher excitation level of curve motion compared with straight motion.	    list reference

As shown in    Fig. 11    (b), the MAEs of RACs estimated by the CDL, UKF, and VDMIDL models is 0.032, 0.041, and 0.017 respectively, which indicates that the deep learning model incorporating physical information can estimate more accurate RAC.	    list reference    	  
The results of the comparison between the CDL, UKF, and VDMIDL models also show that compared with the physics-driven UKF model, the data-driven CDL model has a greater impact on the VDMIDL model.	    list reference    	 
Moreover, the MAE of the DIBF model is 0.026, which shows that compared with the existing DIBF model, the VDMIDL model can achieve higher accuracy of RAC estimation.	    list reference

The result of the vehicle test under uniform road condition indicates that the accuracy and stability of the VDMIDL model is more significant compared with the CDL model and UKF-based model.	    list reference    	 
The result of the vehicle test under nonuniform road condition shows that the VDMIDL model perceives changes in road conditions in advance and predicts the RAC of the road ahead of the vehicle in time.	    list reference    	 
The comparison of the test results fully illustrates the wide applicability of the VDMIDL model.	    list reference    	 
The proposed VDMIDL method can provide more prospective and precise RAC for the vehicle’s trajectory planning, decision-making, and control when the autonomous vehicle travels on roads with variable adhesion coefficients.	    list reference    	 
The proposed fusion estimation method incorporates more physics information of the vehicle into the deep learning-based image recognition method, endowing more interpretability and transparency to the deep learning model.	    list reference    	 
Although this paper constructs interpretable deep learning models from the perspective of input data, more methodologies to increase the interpretability of models deserve to be mined.	    list reference    	 
Future works will explore the integration of more physical knowledge of the vehicle into the architecture, components, and training process of the deep learning model to further enhance the accuracy and interpretability of the deep learning model for RAC estimation.	    list reference    	 
Moreover, improving the accuracy of RAC estimation by expanding the classification of road conditions is a topic that deserves to be further explored.	    list reference    	 
On the basis of a small amount of vehicle test data, incremental learning and parameter fine-tuning of the model trained by the constructed dataset are also feasible research directions in the future.	    list reference
