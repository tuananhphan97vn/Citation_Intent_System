 The process of capturing and cropping road surface images is described in detail. When the autonomous vehicle is driving, the pavement area ahead of the vehicle is captured via the vehicle-mounted camera. The preview position of the vehicle-mounted camera is set to the center position of the pavement area being photographed, and the preview distance <em> P <sub> 1 </sub></em> is defined as the distance from the preview position to the vehicle's front axle. <em> P <sub> 1 </sub></em> is set to 2.5 m in this paper. The preview position and preview distance are shown in <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0045" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="#f0045" name="bf0045"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"> Fig. 9 </span></span></a> . The captured original image is cropped into two images with the size of 240 Ã— 360 pixels, which is the same size as the images in the dataset, along the left and right tire tracks ahead of the vehicle, as shown in of <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="f0005" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="#f0005" name="bf0005"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"> Fig. 1 </span></span></a> (IV). Additionally, the preview position and preview distance vary with the height and pitch angle of the vehicle-mounted camera, which can be determined in advance via static camera calibration. The left and right tire tracks ahead of the vehicle and the cropping position of the images can also be determined in advance via static camera calibration. The frame rate for capturing images by the camera is set to 20 Hz.
